------------------------------------------

>Decentralized e-voting system is implemented using blockchain technology. In this system, the voter can vote in a decentralized network and stay anonymous at the same time. Votes are counted on a real time basis so there is no chance of any votes getting missed. These functions are implemented using smart contracts written in solidity. We have used the ethereum blockchain network to implement this.
