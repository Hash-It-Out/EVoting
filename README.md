<h4>A Blockchain-based voting system that aims to address many of the problems faced in today’s elections and promises new opportunities, from securing transparency, making the voting process more accessible, affordable, and safe.</h4>

-----------------------------------------
### Inspiration

* Around the time of TSEC hackathon, the news was filled with articles and debates claiming that the voting machines were rigged in the recently conducted provincial elections in the state of UP in India. Ballot and EVM are the only methods that have been used for voting for years now, and each has its own drawbacks. 

* We felt that it is imperative to develop a better mechanism for voting. So during the hackathon, we developed a blockchain-based E-voting system. This system retains the benefits of the traditional methods such as anonymity of voters, enables real-time vote counting, and decentralized control, which prevents unfair practices. 

------------------------------------------
### Features

- `Decentralized Control` :  Lesser chance of unfair practices and errors due to **Immutability** and **Transparency**
- `Reduced complications` : As compared to EVM or Ballot, complications are reduced
- `Faster Results` : Enables real-time vote counting
- `Retains benefits of the traditional systems` : Ensures anonymity of voters and provides improved security
